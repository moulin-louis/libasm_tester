Setup: git clone git@github.com:moulin-louis/libasm_tester.git && cd libasm_tester
Usage: ./test_libasm mandatory/bonus/all.
The tester need libasm.a in the parent folder so the quickest way is to clone the repo inside your libasm folder.
Check for errno value but doesnt check for memory leak.
This is a complete tester, always write your own test and test with different tester.

Thank to @Tripouille for some test on the mandatory part.
