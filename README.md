# Tester for libasm 42 project written in CPP

## Setup:
```
git clone git@github.com:moulin-louis/libasm_tester.git
cd libasm_tester
make
```
## Usage: 
- ./test_libasm mandatory/bonus/all.
## Notes:
- The tester need libasm.a in the parent folder so the quickest way is to clone the repo inside your libasm folder.
- Check for errno value but doesnt check for memory leak.
- This is not a complete tester! Always write your own test.

Thank to @Tripouille for some test on the mandatory part.
